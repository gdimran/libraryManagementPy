This a first version of Library Management system using python by me. I will update this using oop and django as well.
Key Features:
1. User can Add books.
2. Update books
3. Search book by using book name, authors, isbn number
4. Can Remove books form the list
5. View all books list
6. Can lend books if a user already lend the same book before then he can't lend before return
7. Also if the books amount is less than 2 the user will get a message"Sorry! not enough books available to lend"
8. Lend books also update automatically in csv files and the quantity and return date automatically update after lend successfull and add and reduce the quantity in both books and lend books files.
